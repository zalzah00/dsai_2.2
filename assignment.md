### Question 1

Question: How would you create a new hash in Redis to store information about a person, with `john_doe` as the key and include the name (`John Doe`), age (`35`), and email address (`john@email.com`)?

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(
  host='redis-10908.c252.ap-southeast-1-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com',
  port=10908,
  password='EgIvxgDuiuk2Sh5VnJzUGXDMtLrtK5Hk')
```

Answer:

```python
r.hset(
    'john doe',
    mapping={
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 35,
        "email": "john@email.com",
    },
)
r.hgetall("john doe")
```

### Question 2

Question: Write Python code to list the first 10 objects (blob name) in the "gcp-public-data-landsat" bucket, along with their sizes.

```python
from google.cloud import storage

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.get_bucket("gcp-public-data-landsat")
```

Answer:

```python
blobs = bucket.list_blobs(max_results=10)
for blob in blobs:
    print(f"Name: {blob.name}, Size: {blob.size} bytes")
```
